|---|---|---|---|---|
| · | `A1` | other | `AXIOM` | THE foundational axiom. Admissibility capacity C is finite and positive: sum epsilon(d) <= C < infinity for all enforceable distinctions d. Not derived. Framework-independent of the specific value of C ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â only finiteness and positivity matter. |
| · | `A1_disjoint_scope` | other | `AXIOM_COROLLARY` | A1 sum_d epsilon(d) <= C is always a valid budget bound. It is an EXACT accounting of capacity consumed iff all M_d are pairwise disjoint. Overlapping mechanisms cause double-counting of shared substrate: sum > actual capacity consumed (overcount = shared_cap). T_sep (disjoint-mechanism condition... |
| · | `D_quotient_forced` | other | `P` | Omega = D-quotient is uniquely forced: no finer (zero-cost DOF inert), no coarser (positive-cost DOF operationally real). |
| · | `L_MD_extension` | lemma | `P_structural` | Lemma 1 of the IJC reference doc: any nonempty perturbation class T admitting a minimal defense act delta_T has cost kappa(delta_T) >= mu* > 0.  Route A selected (FD5 covers threat-defense acts directly; MD applies to delta_T without mediation).  Closes the zero-cost-joint-defense smuggle: withou... |
| · | `L_M_derived` | lemma | `P` | M derived: A1 -> T_field [P] -> C_total = 61 types. 61 >= 2 -> M. MECE partition [3, 16, 42]. Postulate count reduced: {A1, M, NT} -> {A1}. |
| · | `L_NT_derived` | lemma | `P` | NT derived from field content: gauge dimensions 8, 3, 1 give realignment costs 8, 3, 1 (all distinct). Therefore exists d_i, d_j in D with eps(d_i) != eps(d_j). NT holds. |
| · | `L_NZ` | lemma | `P` | No admissible admissibility history contains a Zeno sequence. After L_eps*: at most n_max=10 acts per interface. Admissibility is a realizable commitment process (A1 Aspect 3). |
| · | `L_Omega_sign` | lemma | `P` | First quantitative test of the canonical object. ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â©_inter = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢I(A:B) (negative mutual information) in the quantum-admissible regime. For pure states: \|ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â©_inter\| = 2Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·S_ent. Sign dichotomy: ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â©_local ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 0 generically (L_nc, composition costs more... |
| · | `L_Pi` | lemma | `P+IJC` | GIVEN the IJC premise (branch-(IJC) interface: T(d1,d2) ⊋ T(d1) U T(d2)), Delta(d1,d2) > 0 follows from Lemma 1 (L_MD_extension), and the joint admissibility generator E_{d1,d2} cannot lie in the diagonal subalgebra A_diag = span{E_d}.  Proof by contradiction: A_diag forces cost-additivity, but D... |
| · | `L_T2` | lemma | `P` | Finite non-commuting Hermitian witness (sigma_x, sigma_z) generates concrete matrix *-algebra M_2(C). Concrete state omega=Tr/2 exists constructively. Concrete GNS: H=M_2(C), <a,b>=omega(a*b), pi(x)b=xb. Gram matrix verified PSD with eigenvalues > 0. No C*-completion, no Hahn-Banach, no Kadison n... |
| · | `L_col` | lemma | `P` | Founding-chain lemma (A1 -> {L_nc, L_irr, L_col} -> Theorem_R). Structural content: under A1 the admissibility set is an argmin of the derived cost functional dim(G) (Paper 13 v8.22 App. A.4); process reading: A1 + L_irr force bounded refinement to terminate (Paper 18 v3.20 collapse sketch). Witn... |
| · | `L_cost` | lemma | `P` | A1 cardinality bound + Cauchy functional equation -> the UNIQUE realignment cost is C(E) = n(E)*epsilon. Functional-form rival defeated: n^alpha (C2 additivity). The gauge clause n(G) = dim(G) and the generator-primitivity proofs live in L_cost_gauge (v24.3.404 split); gauge-invariant rivals are ... |
| · | `L_cost_gauge` | lemma | `P` | For a gauge group G the channel count is the group dimension: n(G) = dim(G) (generator primitivity -- Proof A: orbit-separation + Brouwer invariance of domain on Aut(M_n) [T3]; Proof B: L_nc bracket-closure + L_epsilon* marginal cost; either suffices). With L_cost's unique functional: C(G) = dim(... |
| · | `L_epsilon*` | lemma | `P` | No infinitesimal meaningful distinctions. Proof: if eps_Gamma = 0, could pack arbitrarily many independent meaningful distinctions into admissibility physics at vanishing total cost -> admissible perturbations reshuffle at zero cost -> distinctions not robust -> not meaningful. Contradiction. Pre... |
| · | `L_irr` | lemma | `P` | A1 + occupancy + L_loc + L_cost ==> A4. Mechanism: the joint-distinction cost (Delta>0, L_cost form + occupancy input) commits capacity to cross-interface correlations. Locality (L_loc) prevents any single observer from recovering this capacity. Result: irreversibility under local observation. Ve... |
| · | `L_irr_uniform` | lemma | `P` | If gravity is irreversible, any non-trivially coupled gauge-matter sector inherits irreversibility at shared interfaces. Proof: (1) records are local interface objects (L_loc), (2) gauge-gravity coupling via shared enforcement interfaces (T7B), (3) L_nc superadditivity at shared interfaces makes ... |
| · | `L_loc` | lemma | `P` | A1 + M + NT ==> A3. Chain: admissibility physics (floor(C/epsilon) bound) + sufficient richness (N_phys > C/epsilon) -> admissibility must distribute over multiple independent loci -> locality. Verified: 6 distinctions with epsilon=2 fail at single interface (cost 19.5 > C=10) but succeed distrib... |
| · | `L_nc` | lemma | `P` | Non-closure witness: E_1=6, E_2=6 each <= C=10, but E_1+E_2=12 > 10. L_loc (admissibility factorization) guarantees distributed interfaces; A1 (admissibility physics) bounds each. Composition at shared cut-sets exceeds local budgets. Formerly axiom A2; now derived from A1+L_loc. |
| · | `L_threat_substrate_realization` | lemma | `P_structural_reading` | Lemma 2 of the IJC reference doc: under sharp admissibility at a finite-capacity interface satisfying A1+MD+A2+BW, if a pair {d1, d2} is in branch (IJC), then the minimal joint defender W_{12} is NOT contained in M_{d1} (+) M_{d2}.  Equivalently, there exists Pi_{12} ⊆ V_Gamma with Pi_{12} ∩ (M_{... |
| · | `M` | other | `P` | At least 2 distinguishable subsystems exist. The weakest possible non-triviality claim. Without M, A1 is trivially satisfied by a single subsystem. Used only in L_loc derivation. DERIVED from A1 via L_M_derived [P] (v5.3.4): T_field → 61 types. |
| · | `M_Omega` | other | `P` | At full saturation (Bekenstein limit), non-uniform measure over microstates requires extra distinctions (Step 1) that cost admissibility capacity (Step 2, L_epsilon*) unavailable at saturation (Step 3). Uniformity is the unique permutation-invariant assignment introducing no extra distinctions (S... |
| · | `NT` | other | `P` | NT: there exist distinctions d_i, d_j with eps(d_i) != eps(d_j). Witness: eps(d_1)=2, eps(d_2)=3, C=5 -> residual budgets 3 vs 2 differ. Without NT all costs equal eps*, residual budgets C-eps* identical, T1 Step 2 produces no asymmetry and order-dependence fails. DERIVED from A1 via L_NT_derived... |
| · | `OR2_repetition` | other | `P` | 3-bit repetition code: destruction = detection = d_min = 2 bit-flips. Per-event maintenance cost in [1, 4/3] for all p in (0, 1/2). OR2-strong holds at code-distance scale. Time-averaged maintenance -> 0 as p -> 0 is a rate phenomenon, not a per-event cost failure. |
| · | `OR2_spin` | other | `P` | For spin-1/2 in Zeeman field Delta_E coupled to thermal bath: destruction cost = maintenance cost per event = detection cost (WAY bound) = Delta_E. OR2-strong holds in strong-gap regime (Delta_E >> k_BT). Gap-collapse limit Delta_E -> 0 causes d to exit D (APF inapplicable by design), not an OR2 ... |
| · | `OR2_steane` | other | `P` | Steane [[7,1,3]] code: destruction = d_min = 3 Paulis. Detection (bare logical qubit) = 30 ops; OR2-strong fails for bare logical. Resolution (L_loc): ancilla syndrome apparatus is co-located with logical qubit and must be included in the enforcement interface. Composite interface maintenance ~ 1... |
| · | `P4_IMP` | other | `P` | Interface Maintenance Principle: two distinctions sharing interface Gamma require maintaining d_Gamma (the interface capacity itself) in D. Robustness gives c_Gamma >= epsilon(d_Gamma) > 0. LP with cross-talk kappa: D_joint = eps1+eps2+c_Gamma*(1-2*kappa). Strict inequality holds for kappa < 1/2 ... |
| · | `P_cls` | other | `P` | Over C: tensor product stays in complex matrix class. Over H: composite exits quaternionic class (Adler 1995). L_loc forbids the new DOF this would require. |
| · | `P_exhaust` | other | `P` | Two mechanism predicates -- Q1 (gauge addressability, from T3) and Q2 (SU(3) confinement) -- are the ONLY independent mechanism-level partition criteria at Bekenstein saturation. Proof by sector-by-sector exhaustion: vacuum cannot split (contradiction with Q1=0 definition), dark cannot split (no ... |
| · | `P_tom` | other | `P` | Layer 1: L_loc gives surplus=0. Layer 2: exhaustion excludes zero-cost antisymmetric correlator. K_joint(C)=16=K_local; K_joint(R)=10>9=K_local. |
| · | `T0` | theorem | `P` | Axiom satisfiability witnesses: (A1) 4-node ledger with superadditivity Delta=4; (L_irr) monotone 2-interface world with 3 distinctions -- correlation c spans both interfaces, locally unrecoverable (Delta_S(s,c)=3, costs 8 at Gamma_S and 8 at Gamma_E); (L_nc) sigma_x, sigma_z non-commuting admiss... |
| · | `T1` | theorem | `P` | Non-closure of distinction set under admissibility composition implies existence of incompatible observable pairs. Witness: sigma_x and sigma_z are each Hermitian (observable) but [sigma_x, sigma_z] != 0 and their product is not Hermitian. Therefore no common eigenbasis exists -- they cannot be j... |
| · | `T1b` | theorem | `P` | T1 gives E_d1 != E_d2 on Omega. OR2/T_adj gives self-adjointness. T1b: Alg_R{E_d} is a real *-algebra. The sector projections commute; noncommutativity is introduced by F_Pi (L_Pi -> T_alg). |
| · | `T2` | theorem | `P` | Non-closure (L_nc) forces non-commutative *-algebra. CORE CLAIM [P]: L_T2 proves constructively that M_2(C) with trace state gives a concrete 4-dim GNS Hilbert space representation -- no C*-completion, no Hahn-Banach needed. This finite witness is all the derivation chain requires. Extension to f... |
| · | `T2b` | theorem | `P` | Paper 1 spine (archived 180p supplement, T2b): the enforcement algebra -- finite-dimensional real *-algebra with faithful positive state omega (O4) and *-involution (OR2) -- complexifies to a semisimple complex *-algebra; Wedderburn--Artin gives A_C ~= (+)_k M_{n_k}(C) acting faithfully on (+)_k ... |
| · | `T3` | theorem | `P` | Local admissibility at each point -> local automorphism group. Skolem-Noether: Aut*(M_n) ~= PU(n). Continuity over base space -> principal G-bundle. Gauge connection = parallel transport of admissibility frames. Yang-Mills dynamics requires additional assumptions (stated explicitly). v5.3.5: Dopl... |
| · | `T_Born` | theorem | `P` | Born rule p(E) = Tr(rhoE) is the UNIQUE probability assignment satisfying positivity, additivity, normalization, and admissibility invariance in dim >= 3 (Gleason's theorem). Verified on 3D witness with projective and non-projective POVMs, plus unitary invariance check. |
| · | `T_CPTP` | theorem | `P` | CPTP maps are the unique admissibility-preserving evolution channels. Verified: amplitude damping channel with Kraus operators satisfies TP (Sigma K+K = I), CP ((PhiI) preserves PSD on extended system), and outputs valid density matrices. Transpose shown NOT CP via Peres criterion (negative parti... |
| · | `T_Hermitian` | theorem | `P` | In the T2 Hilbert-space representation, observable sector is A_sa. Self-adjoint elements have real spectrum by spectral theorem. This is a representation convention (real eigenvalues <=> real realignment costs from A1), not derived from L_irr or decoherence. Verified: sigma_x, sigma_z in A_sa wit... |
| · | `T_IJC_dichotomy` | theorem | `P_structural` | Theorem 1 of the IJC reference doc: for any pair {d1, d2} of jointly meaningful distinctions at an interface, exactly one of (Sep) T(d1,d2) = T(d1) U T(d2) or (IJC) T(d1,d2) ⊋ T(d1) U T(d2) holds. Structurally a tautology (logical exhaustion on set inclusion); operationalized here on two test int... |
| · | `T_IJC_from_partition_structure` | theorem | `P+IJC` | Phase 20 sharpened derivation theorem.  Under FD1 (substrate as set of configurations) + FD3 (distinctions as binary partitions) + FD2 substrate richness (multiple configs per joint cell) + FD4 + MD (positive cost floor on perturbations), IJC is derived for any pair {d1, d2} whose joint refinemen... |
| · | `T_M` | theorem | `P` | Independence  disjoint anchors. Full proof: () L_loc factorization gives independent budgets at disjoint interfaces. (=>) Shared anchor -> finite budget competition at that interface -> detectable correlation -> not independent. Monogamy (degree-1) follows at saturation C_i = epsilon. |
| · | `T_Tsirelson` | theorem | `P` | Cirelson identity verified: S^2 = 4I - [a1,a2]x[b1,b2]. Commutator norms <= 2 (from a^2=I in M_n(C)). \|\|S\|\| = 2.828427 = 2*sqrt(2). Saturated by maximally entangled state. Quantum bound > classical bound 2. |
| · | `T_adj` | theorem | `P` | Paper 1 Technical Supplement (spine-era T_adj, thm:Tadj_sector): each sector map E_d is the B-orthogonal projection onto its anchor M_d w.r.t. the block-orthogonal bilinear form forced by the sector decomposition (L_omega content, instantiated in-body): E_d^2 = E_d, E_d^dagger = E_d, ker(E_d) = t... |
| · | `T_adj_commutes` | theorem | `P` | T_adj Step 2 defines E_d\|_{M_d}=id, E_d\|_{M_d'}=0, E_d\|_Pi=0. From these definitions: E_d1*E_d2 = 0 = E_d2*E_d1 for all d1!=d2, so [E_d1,E_d2] = 0. The diagonal subalgebra A_diag = span{E_d} is commutative (isomorphic to R^\|D\|). This is the classical regime. The full algebra A strictly contains A... |
| · | `T_alg` | theorem | `P+IJC` | The algebra A = Alg{E_d} generated by admissibility maps has no faithful commutative representation.  Phase 19h AUDIT (2026-04-26): the abstract order-dependence route in the original docstring is a STRUCTURAL SKETCH, not load-bearing; the implication "commutativity => E_d3 E_d1 = E_d3 E_d2" does... |
| · | `T_alg_FPi` | theorem | `P+IJC` | T_alg revised: noncommutativity [E_d1, F_Pi] != 0 proved directly. Key steps: (1) E_d1\|_Pi = 0 (T_adj Step 2). (2) F_Pi\|_Pi != 0 (L_Pi Step 5). (3) For v in Pi: E_d1(F_Pi(v)) != 0 but F_Pi(E_d1(v)) = F_Pi(0) = 0. Therefore [E_d1, F_Pi] != 0. No GNS construction needed. M_2(C) witness (corrected):... |
| · | `T_branch_taxonomy_inclusions` | theorem | `P_regime` | The branch-taxonomy inclusions of Paper 5 v5.1 (Lemmas 4.5, 4.6) hold on the canonical witnesses. SepAdm always implies SepStr (an admissible defender is a fortiori a defender); structural IJC always implies admissible IJC (no commuting defender at all means no admissible commuting defender). The... |
| · | `T_canonical` | theorem | `P` | Paper 13 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§9. The admissibility structure is a sheaf of distinction sets with non-local cost. LOCAL: Adm_Gamma is finite order ideal, bounded depth floor(C/eps), not sublattice, generated by antichain Max(Gamma). INTER-INTERFACE: restriction maps from admissibility footprint; set-level sep... |
| · | `T_entropy` | theorem | `P` | Entropy = irreversibly committed correlation capacity at interfaces. In quantum regimes, S(rho) = -Tr(rho log rho). Verified: S(pure)=0, S(max_mixed)=1.0986=log(3), 0 < S(mid) < log(d), subadditivity S(AB) <= S(A)+S(B), concavity of mixing. |
| · | `T_epsilon` | theorem | `P` | Minimum nonzero realignment cost epsilon > 0 exists. From L_epsilon* (meaningful distinctions have minimum admissibility quantum eps_Gamma > 0) + A1 (admissibility physics bounds total cost). eps = eps_Gamma is the infimum over all independent meaningful distinctions. Previous gap ("finite distin... |
| · | `T_eta` | theorem | `P` | eta/epsilon <= 1. Full proof: T_M gives monogamy (at most 1 independent correlation per distinction). A1 gives budget epsilon + eta <= C_i. T_kappa gives C_i >= 2*epsilon. At saturation (C_i = 2*epsilon): eta <= epsilon. Tight at saturation. |
| · | `T_inseparable_IJC` | theorem | `P+IJC` | Phase 21 strengthened Dichotomy.  The Phase-19 IJC framing (set-theoretic excess of joint threat) is necessary but not sufficient to force noncommutativity: the auditor exhibited a substrate that admits a factorization S = Q × Π under which an independent commuting d_Pi defends the joint threat, ... |
| · | `T_kappa` | theorem | `P` | kappa = 2. Lower bound [P]: L_nc (system interface Gamma_S) + L_irr (environment interface Gamma_E) give two independent epsilon-commitments at separate interfaces -> kappa >= 2. Upper bound [P_structural]: distinction spans at most two interfaces (system + environment); third interface requires ... |
| · | `T_mode_partition_conservation` | theorem | `P+IJC` | Phase 19o follow-up bank check landing Prop 2.3 from the conservation/boats-parable reference doc.  At a branch-(IJC) interface with substrate V = M_d1 (+) M_d2 (+) Pi_12, the mode decomposition V_+ (common) + V_- (differential) + V_Pi (pool) carries the cost-budget structure: F_Pi annihilates V_... |
| · | `T_no_IJC_no_noncommutativity` | theorem | `P_structural` | Spectator countermodel: V = M_d1 (+) M_d2 (+) Pi with Pi inert. A1 + MD + A2 + BW all PASS. Pair {d1, d2} in branch (Sep) of the IJC dichotomy theorem: T(d1, d2) = T(d1) U T(d2). Joint defender W_{12} = M_d1 (+) M_d2 is block-diagonal; Delta = 0; F_Pi = 0; [E_d1, E_{d1,d2}] = [E_d2, E_{d1,d2}] = ... |
| · | `T_quantum_admissibility_condition` | theorem | `P_regime` | Paper 5 v5.1 Theorem 1518 (IJC produces a QAC witness in record-complete coherent interfaces): branch (IJC) plus record-completeness plus coherent-continuation richness produces a Quantum Admissibility Condition witness -- coherent continuations whose Boolean record-locking incurs strictly positi... |
| · | `T_sep` | theorem | `P` | Paper 1 Technical Supplement (spine-era T_sep^op / T_sep): independently enforceable distinctions have disjoint anchors iff joint enforcement cost is exactly additive; a maximal antichain induces the pre-metric direct sum S_Gamma = (+)_d M_d (+) Pi. Forward: FD3 locality + K3 additivity. Converse... |
| · | `T_tensor` | theorem | `P` | Tensor product H_A H_B is the minimal composite space satisfying bilinear composition and closure. Verified: dim(2 x 3) = 6, product states have pure subsystems (purity=1), entangled states have mixed subsystems (S_ent = 0.6931 > 0). Bilinearity confirmed. |
| · | `disjoint_partition` | other | `P` | Substrate disjointness derived from L_cost integrality: eps* is indivisible across interfaces. |
| · | `kappa_zero_Tsep` | other | `P` | Under T_sep disjoint-mechanism condition: delta_Gamma (substrate defense, in S_Gamma\(M_d1 cup M_d2)) and delta_i (mechanism defense, in M_di) occupy physically disjoint regions. Disjoint regions => zero cross-coverage => kappa = 0 (derived from T_sep, not assumed). kappa=0 => Delta = c_Gamma >= ... |
| · | `state_sensitivity` | other | `P+IJC` | Over R: K=3<N^2=4 (states blind to commutators). L_Delta gives Delta>0 detectable. F=R makes Delta undetectable: contradiction. Over H: K=6>N^2. F=C uniquely selected. [P+IJC] post-Phase-19g cascade: depends on T_alg which depends on L_Pi (IJC carrier). |
| · | `worked_example` | other | `P` | C=5, eps(d1)=2, eps(d2)=3, eps(d3)=5/2. Delta(d1,d2)=4>0 (superadditivity). BW: {d1,d3} admissible (residual 1/2), {d2,d3} inadmissible (residual -1/2). T1 witness: order-dependent admissibility outcomes. |

Root cause: ratio anchored by a12, a23 (zero freedom). d_1 variation x^(7/4)->x^6: ratio shifts 0.0080 absolute (gap to exp unchanged). Fix: M_R2/M_R3~1.85. Open problem: derive from A1. |

NNLO: c = x^{2d} = 0.0039, θ = π/3, w = nearest-neighbor lifts m_d. Hierarchy: m_b²/m_d² ~ 1.2e+06. Zero Fritzsch imports. "Capacity rank-2 texture" not "Fritzsch texture." |

| · | `check_T_apf_planck_cell_normalization` | theorem | `—` | Under the APF substrate-unit convention (hbar, c, G = one enforcement, coordination, interface-load unit each), the minimal cell at joint single-unit saturation is A_cell = l_P^2, so kappa = 1. Stronger than dimensional analysis, weaker than a UV microstate calc: it fixes the prefactor by countin... |

Structural sufficiency only; actual richness is the physical gate [C_actual_Hawking_radiation_correlation_richness]. |
