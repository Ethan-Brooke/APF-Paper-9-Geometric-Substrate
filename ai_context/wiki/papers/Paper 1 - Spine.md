# Paper 1 - Spine
## "The Enforceability of Distinction"

**Two deposits, two roles.**
- **Main body (v5.0, 48pp, published 2026-04-28).** Argument-first companion to the standalone formal-foundation paper. Concept DOI [10.5281/zenodo.18439200](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18439200) (canonical citation, preserved); v5.0 version DOI [10.5281/zenodo.19872948](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19872948). File: `Paper_1_Enforceability_of_Distinction_v5.0.{tex,pdf}`. v5.0 is a scope-control pass over v4.9: §3 retitled "from finite capacity to noncommutative continuation structure"; the three Hilbert/Born/Tsirelson subsections retitled with "Preview:" prefix to mark them as forward-pointing rather than completed Paper 1 results; "all classical models are excluded" softened to "faithful commutative Boolean-record defenders for the declared finite tested interface are excluded" at all three sites; abstract, §1 intro, §3 lead, T2 closure, §6.4 Summary all reframed for body-internal consistency. No theorem content changed. Body claim posture now matches what the v8.8 supplement actually backs: Sep/IJC classification + noncommutative continuation structure on the (IJC) branch are formally derived; complex Hilbert representation, Born rule, and Tsirelson-type bounds are previewed and deferred to Paper 5. Predecessor v4.9 is at version DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19871826.
- **Standalone formal foundation (v8.8, published 2026-04-28).** Title: *The Enforceability of Distinction: Admissible Possibility Spaces, Continuation Algebra, and the Sep/IJC Representation Theorem*. concept DOI **[10.5281/zenodo.19714957](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19714957)** (stable citation; resolves to latest version); v8.8 version DOI **[10.5281/zenodo.19871225](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19871225)** — minted as the publication artifact for journal submission (Phase 23.2; Quantum primary target). File: `Paper_1_Enforceability_of_Distinction_Supplement_v8.8.{tex,pdf}`. Mathematical core is the Sep/IJC Representation Theorem stated as a finite-Boolean-feasibility biconditional; primitive spine = continuation identity + finite enforceable distinction + positive enforcement cost; trigger-condition discipline named at point of use; ε-faithful defenders + finite-margin robustness covered. Standalone — no prior APF exposure required.

**Status:** v4.0-PLEC (April 2026), **44pp** (audit-edit pass applied 2026-04-17; wayfinder convention added 2026-04-18). PLEC rollout complete — Enforceability of Distinction (ontological foundation) + PLEC (variational formulation) with four structurally necessary components A1, MD, A2, BW. Five interpretive bridge boxes added grounding the derivation chain in concrete physics (Pauli exclusion, uncertainty relation, Planck quantization, Stern-Gerlach, Aharonov-Bohm, coupled superconducting resonators). New "Operational primitives" wayfinder box at start of §2 mapping distinction / maintained / enforcement cost to their motivation, formalization, and measurement-protocol sites.

**Core claim:** Physical meaning is grounded in *enforceable distinction*; the [[Principle of Least Enforcement Cost]] (PLEC) is its canonical variational formulation in admissible regimes. PLEC has four structurally necessary components: [[Axiom A1]] (Finite Enforcement Capacity — PLEC upper bound), **MD** (Minimum Distinction — PLEC positive floor), **A2** (Minimum Cost — PLEC argmin selection), **BW** (Bound Wideness — PLEC non-degeneracy). Together they force the existence of the canonical object — a complex Hilbert space with the Born rule, finite-dimensional irreps of $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$, and deterministic mass/mixing ratios. Zero free parameters.

**Key theorems (22 boxed results, PLEC framing):**
- §1.3 tcolorbox "The Principle of Least Enforcement Cost: four structurally necessary components" (A1 upper bound, MD positive floor, A2 argmin, BW non-degeneracy)
- §2.1 "Enforceability and its variational expression" with existing A1/A2/MD/BW tcolorboxes preserved; load-bearing line: "Enforceability of Distinction... is the ontological foundation; PLEC is its variational formulation; none of the four components is derivable from the others (see Technical Supplement essentiality proofs)"
- T_sep (Separation Biconditional), **L_ε* (Minimum Cost Floor — renamed to avoid collision with A2)**, L_cost (Cost Uniqueness), L_loc (Locality), NT (Non-Degeneracy), L_nc (Non-Closure)
- L_Δ (Superadditivity — the watershed), L_irr (Irreversibility)
- T1 (Order-Dependence — the bridge theorem), T_adj (Self-Adjointness), L_blk + T_alg (Noncommutativity)
- T2 (Hilbert Space), T_Born (Born Rule), T_Tsirelson (Tsirelson Bound)
- T1-NB (Non-Boolean second route), T_canonical, Conditional theorems, L_M/L_NT derived

- [[Axiom A1]] statement and physical grounding (§2)
- Definitions and structural lemmas — arena chain (§3)

**Theorem register:** 82 entries in 6 sections, with `†` markers for supplement.py checks.

**Changelog:**
- 2026-04-17: v4.0-PLEC audit-edit pass — 12 surgical edits driven by the Paper 0 ontology audit. Four copy-edits: §1.1 "The question is then immediate" → "With enforcement named, the framework's central question can be stated..."; §1.3 "The APF answers a prior question" → "one step upstream of these programs"; §2 "was quietly taking" → "had left implicit"; §3.2 "enforcement-theoretic origin of irreversibility" → "how irreversibility emerges from finite capacity --- not as a contingent statistical fact, but as a structural feature of the admissibility budget itself". Two figure fixes: Fig 3 Arena DAG C<∞ edge label repositioned (pos 0.3 → 0.72); Fig 5 Bridge DAG red→black on all right-column "classical model fails" labels + arrows, labels shifted x=6.0→7.0 to clear BW node, T_adj-targeted arrow rerouted with `bend right=25` (previously landed at phantom `Tadj.east+(3.2,0)` cutting through T1). Mead 2000 "identically" claim investigated against local book copy (§§4.5–4.8; equations 4.17, 4.18, 4.20, 4.22, 4.27, 4.31, 4.32 verified) — dynamical-identity claim retracted as overclaim (Mead's equations are dynamical, L_Δ is static superadditivity); restored as a physical-anchor tcolorbox with verified equation citations and structural-mapping discipline. Five interpretive bridge tcolorboxes added: (i) L_nc→L_Δ "The gap where classical models end" with Pauli-exclusion and uncertainty-relation examples; (ii) L_ε*→L_cost "From a floor to a ladder" with Planck's step; (iii) the T1/T_adj/L_blk/T_alg chain grounded in Stern-Gerlach three-apparatus sequence; (iv) T_2c "Why exactly ℂ" with Aharonov-Bohm anchor; (v) coupled superconducting resonators as L_Δ instance with Mead equations. Clean compile: 40pp → 44pp. Archive: `Old/paper1_v4.0-PLEC_pre-P0audit.tex`/`.pdf`.
- 2026-04-16: v4.0-PLEC — PLEC rollout (presentation-layer only, no theorems/proofs changed). Four edit sites on main body: (1) abstract expanded with Enforceability of Distinction ontological foundation + PLEC as variational formulation; (2) §1 intro subordination paragraph + four-component preview; (3) §1.3 tcolorbox retitled "The Principle of Least Enforcement Cost: four structurally necessary components," body rewritten to cover A1/MD/A2/BW; (4) §2.1 renamed "Enforcea
