# Paper 6 - Dynamics and Geometry
## "Spacetime, Gravity, and Cosmology"

**Status:** **v2.1 main (19pp) + Technical Supplement v1.1 (39pp)** (Phase 12.2 primary bridge-theorem receiver, 2026-04-21). Paper 6 houses T11 ($\Omega_\Lambda = 42/61$), $T_{\mathrm{Bek}}$, $T_{\mathrm{deSitter\_entropy}}$, and $T_{\mathrm{horizon\_reciprocity}}$ — all four theorems are co-witnessed by the `apf/gravity.py` interface-sector bridge at the 42-dim subspace $V_{\mathrm{global}}$. Earlier: v2.0-PLEC/v1.0 (2026-04-19 evening).

**Changelog:**
- **v2.1 main + Supplement v1.1 (2026-04-21):** Phase 12.2 Bridge Theorem + I2 ingest. Supplement: new §sec:Lambda_subspace promoting $\Omega_\Lambda = 42/61$ to subspace-level structural identity with three co-witnesses (T12, $T_{\mathrm{Bek}}$, $L_{\mathrm{self\,exclusion}}$); $T_{\mathrm{horizon\,reciprocity}}$ subsection expanded with Sector A (bilateral, 60) / Sector B ($V_{\mathrm{global}}$, 42) / $d_{\mathrm{eff}} = 102$ propositions + corollary; new §sec:Bridge_compressed with compressed statements of $T_{\mathrm{interface\,sector\,bridge}}$ + $L_{\mathrm{global\,interface\,is\,horizon}}$ + three corollaries C1/C2/C3 + "strictly finer than I2" dimension-functor framing; $H_0$ falsifier (§sec:H0_tension) gains subspace-level-twin paragraph (bridge pins subspace, $I2$ pins integer); assumption inventory extended with $T_M$ monogamy + $T_{\mathrm{ACC\,unification}}$ imports; theorem index extended with 10 new rows. Main: new "Subspace reading of the 42" paragraph in §T11 Planck-match; twin-falsifier paragraph in §H0-status linking $I2$ and bridge; tagging table gains 2 rows; Summary bullet on $V_{\mathrm{global}}$ co-witness. Archive: `Old/Paper_6_*_pre-Phase12.2.{tex,pdf}`. Upstream reference: Three-Layer Ontology doc §9. One pre-existing undefined `\ref{lem:conditional_enforceability}` warning inherited from v1.0 (cross-document reference to Paper 5 Supplement).

**Core claim:** The admissibility framework connects quantum field theory to classical spacetime geometry and cosmology. Derives Einstein's equations, cosmological density fractions (Ω_Λ, Ω_m, Ω_r), neutrino masses, and N_eff predictions from the same principle.

**Key theorems:**
- L_equip (`check_L_equip`) — Equipartition of energy into sectors
- L_dark_budget (`check_dark_budget`) — Cosmological constant forced at observed value
- L_N_eff_prediction (`check_N_eff`) — Effective number of neutrino species
- L_equation_of_state (`check_w_DE`) — Dynamical dark energy equation of state
- Neutrino mass ratios from enforcement cost hierarchies
- [[Cosmological Predictions]] — Ω_Λ, Ω_m, Ω_r, H_0, η_B

**Content:**
- Transition from quantum field theory to spacetime geometry
- Enforcement cost in the gravitational sector
- Why a positive cosmological constant (dark energy)
- Density fractions: matter, radiation, dark energy
- Neutrino physics and oscillation parameters
- Predictions vs. WMAP, Planck, DESI observations
- Open question: fully derive Riemannian geometry from A1

**Implementation:** `gravity.py` (9 checks) + `spacetime.py` (8 checks) + `cosmology.py` (17 checks)

**Status notes:**
- Fully implemented in v6.9
- v2.0-PLEC main paper stable; Technical Supplement v1.0 built fresh 2026-04-19 evening as 37pp self-contained formal companion.
- Supplement contents: PLEC + imported-lemma restatements from Papers 1–5 + formal Regime R with five-type exit taxonomy (Types I–V formalized from `plec.py`) + four paper-specific hypotheses H1–H4. PLEC path form + Euler–Lagrange derivation; full regime-exit classification with exhaustiveness theorem; correlation cost → distance → geodesic derivation; T_7B Lorentzian signature via L_irr + L_loc; T_8 spacetime d = 4 via the full six-Δ chain (Δ_ordering, Δ_fbc, Δ_particle, Δ_continuum, Δ_signature, Δ_closure); T_{9grav} + T_{10} curvature from capacity-gradient structure; A9 unified closure + Lovelock uniqueness + Einstein field equations + T_graviton (spin 2 massless; Weinberg–Witten spin > 1 exclusion); T_{11} cosmological constant as Ω_Λ = 42/61; four-parameter Planck match (Ω_Λ, Ω_m, Ω_b, Ω_c within 1.2% with sub-partition 19 = 3 + 16); H_0 = 67.76 ± 0.42 km/s/Mpc prediction; **H0 tension formalized as explicit `falsifier` environment** (7.09σ vs H0DN 2026; Routes I–IV excluded, Route V admissible but insufficient by factor of ~2); T_{12}/T_{12E} dark matter as external 16-unit capacity with open bridge theorem for particle identification; T_Bek + T_deSitter_entropy (61 ln 102 ≈ 282.12 nats) + T_horizon_reciprocity + three-entropies unification; neutrino/cosmology (Σm_ν, N_eff, D/H, GW, singularity resolution as Type IV); six countermodels; red-team on H1/H2/H3/H4 + two meta-attacks; theorem index (40+ entries) + dependency diagram.
- **Phase 10 status:** supplement present, pending Stanford agentic review cycle. H0 falsifier is the load-bearing experimental-risk statement.
