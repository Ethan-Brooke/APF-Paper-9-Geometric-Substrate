"""The continuation calculus on finite cost models: greedoid structure + selection.

BANKED v24.3.375 (2026-07-04; walks + witnesses of 2026-07-03). The Paper 10 Supplement B3/B4 package, landed
from the Mythos-review walk of record: "Reference - The Greedoid Structure of
Admissibility and the Selection Theorems - B3+B4 Walk (2026-07-03)" v0.3
(hostile-audited LAND-WITH-FIXES 0.85 at v0.2; the v0.3 principal ruling
below). Standalone machine witness: The Turning/b3b4_witness_2026-07-03.py,
13/13 PASS at seeds 20260703 and 42. Paper anchors: Paper 10 Technical
Supplement v0.1 sec:b34-greedoid (greedoid structure + weakened bound) and
sec:b5-erec (E_rec selection); main paper Paper 10 v1.15 sec:plec-recovery.

THE OBJECT. A finite admissible-family cost model at a context Gamma:
labels X, a feasible family F of subsets with held-available costs
kappa_Gamma(S), and a capacity C_Gamma, under three axioms:
  (M1) the empty family is feasible at cost 0        [unit, Cost(1) = 0]
  (M2) kappa(S) <= C_Gamma for all feasible S        [admissibility]
  (M3) every realized single-addition increment pays >= eps > 0; the
       marginal floor eps* is their minimum          [the MD floor]
This is the set-system presentation of Paper 10's calculus of finite
continuability; the floor eps* is the calculus's marginal-floor object.

THE PRINCIPAL RULING OF RECORD (2026-07-03, note v0.3 sec 2.5): the floor's
index set is COMPOSITE-INCLUSIVE ("go with the stronger one") -- Paper 10's
floor quantifies over every tested distinction-expression including
composites, so every feasible cover step (block or single) pays >= eps*.
Consequences in force, certified structurally here: the block floor BF is
DERIVABLE from the floor, and the weakened bound |S| <= N + J(S) is
UNCONDITIONAL -- the ruled citable form downstream. The atomic-reading
analysis (on which BF is a removable side hypothesis and the zero-cost
block breaks every bound) is retained as record in the note, not as the
citable form.

WHAT check_T_admissibility_greedoid_structure CERTIFIES (tier 4,
[P_structural]) -- the B3 package:
  1. Randomized accessible models (hereditary truncations of modular +
     pairwise costs): the floor exists, accessibility holds, every feasible
     family obeys the capacity-floor bound |S| <= N = floor(C_Gamma/eps*),
     and every feasible S is chain-buildable (Thm B3.3 shape:
     accessibility ==> chain-buildability ==> the bound).
  2. Greedoid exchange + empty set ==> accessibility (two constructed
     greedoids -- a branching greedoid and a uniform matroid -- plus a
     randomized family scan finding zero violations).
  3. Union-closure does NOT imply accessibility (explicit two-element
     model F = {empty, {1,2}}): the lattice-side closure property is
     independent of the chain-side one.
  4. M_coop (cooperative pair {A,B} jointly admissible, singletons not):
     accessibility FAILS, the bound's conclusion survives (max |S| <= N).
  5. M_break (anomaly-type 4-block at cost 2, floor priced by a witness
     singleton): the naive bound genuinely FAILS (|S*| = 4 > N = 2); the
     weakened bound |S| <= N + J(S) holds with J(S) = |S| - ell(S) the
     cooperative-passenger count (ell = longest feasible cover chain).
     Under the composite-inclusive ruling this weakened bound is
     UNCONDITIONAL -- the in-check block-floor leg witnesses BF on M_break.
  6. M_incomp (audit-donated): an accessible model whose block floor FAILS
     (a genuine multi-element cover paying 0.5 < eps* = 1). BF and
     accessibility are INCOMPARABLE -- at the MODEL level: M_incomp is a
     model of the bare axioms (M1)-(M3), NOT of the calculus post-ruling
     (the composite-inclusive floor excludes its cheap cover by pricing
     every tested composite at >= eps*). It is retained as the axiom-level
     independence witness, exactly as the note's sec 2.4 scopes it.
  7. The greedy failure (Thm B3.5 shape): in the hereditary + modular case
     the myopic greedy = sorted order minimizes the holding burden
     B(pi) = sum of prefix costs (brute force over all orders); in a
     general greedoid it does NOT -- the branching greedoid has greedy
     B = 15.0 vs feasible optimum 14.5. No unconditional greedoid-level
     greedy theorem for the holding burden exists.

WHAT check_T_selection_approximate_A2 CERTIFIES (tier 4, [P_structural])
-- the B4 package, the derived tightness/selection content of Paper 10
v1.15 sec:plec-recovery. Paper 10's A2 (argmin selection) and BW
(cost-spectrum non-degeneracy) are constitutive commitments;
SELECTION-AMONG-ALTERNATIVES REMAINS THE NAMED OPEN. This check certifies
the derived approximate form and its hypotheses' sharpness:
  1. Strictly-PD discretized E_rec kernel on the probability simplex:
     two projected-gradient-descent runs from very different starts
     converge to the SAME minimizer (uniqueness = the BW-side content that
     strict positive-definiteness buys).
  2. Degenerate (PSD, zero on mean-zero directions) kernel: distinct
     profiles with IDENTICAL energy -- ties exist, BW fails; uniqueness is
     not free.
  3. Kernel I + c*(1 (x) 1) with c > 0 (degenerate only along constants):
     uniqueness INHERITED from the strictly-PD mean-zero part -- the
     physically relevant degeneracy class keeps the selection.
  4. THE APPROXIMATE-A2 THEOREM with the honest independent sampler
     (audit MINOR-1 repair, carried): marginals and capacity drawn
     INDEPENDENTLY, saturation certified by REJECTION (floor(C/eps*) = k
     and the family fits), and the squeeze inequalities -- total slack
     < eps*, each slack < eps*, average slack < eps*/k, marginal squeeze
     -- tested on the survivors only, so the squeeze emerges from the
     theorem's hypotheses, not from the sampler.
  5. SHARPNESS: total slack = eps* - delta approaches eps* (delta-
     construction), with saturation certified in EXACT RATIONAL arithmetic
     (fractions.Fraction floor division) at the float-ambiguous quotient
     C/eps* = k + 1 - 1e-9 -- exactly the regime where a float fudge
     would be untrustworthy. So sigma/eps* -> 1 is attained in the limit
     and never at it: the approximate-A2 bound is tight.

STATUS. Both checks [P_structural] tier 4: structural theorems over the
finite cost-model class, machine-verified on constructed + randomized
models (rng seeded 20260703; deterministic). They do NOT derive A2 or BW
as theorems -- A2's selection-among-exact-ties and BW's non-degeneracy
remain named constitutive commitments of the calculus (Paper 10 v1.15;
the Mythos-review record: tightness/grading derived, selection/
non-degeneracy named opens).

FALSIFIERS: a finite cost model satisfying (M1)-(M3) + accessibility that
violates |S| <= floor(C/eps*); a greedoid (exchange + empty) that is not
accessible; a jointly admissible family violating |S| <= N + J(S) under
the composite-inclusive floor; a strictly-PD E_rec instance with two
distinct simplex minimizers; a saturated admissible instance with total
slack >= eps*.
