"""The gamma_C carrier program: the fork, the two no-gos, the weight-one reduction.

BANKED v24.3.375 (2026-07-04; walks + witnesses of 2026-07-03). The no-trace-gate program instruments from the
three walks of record (all 2026-07-03, all hostile-audit-repaired v0.2+):
  (1) "Reference - The No-Trace Gate Against the Recruitment Instruments -
      The Carrier Fork and the Reservoir-Exclusion Route" -- the parent walk:
      the four-point carrier fork, the T4 dimension audit, the pooled/
      Nordstrom and per-channel Cassini kills, the reservoir-exclusion route
      named as the live open (L1 open + L2 banked + L3 finite).
  (2) "Reference - The Master-Equation Route Is Carrier-Blind - T2-Prime and
      the Eleven-Check Tripwire" -- T2' (LAND-WITH-FIXES 0.85): the Papers
      24/25 master-equation package adds no constraint on (lambda_t,
      lambda_s); the countermodel extends through the full derived corpus;
      the fence is removed WITH A TRIPWIRE on the recruitment.py instrument
      count.
  (3) "Reference - The Register-Carrier Lemma Walked - The Typing Dilemma,
      H6-Prime, and the Weight-One Opener" -- REDUCED with a proved
      refutation component (LAND-WITH-FIXES 0.85): T-RC1 at schema strength
      (rule-choice = response-choice), the T_M three-typing census, the
      signed mechanism-limit legs, H6' as target spec, and the weight-one
      curve gamma(w) = w/((n-1)-w) as the audit-donated opener.
Machine witnesses (The Turning/, all PASS): c1_notrace_witness_2026-07-03.py
(9/9), mastereq_carrier_witness_2026-07-03.py (27/27),
register_carrier_witness_2026-07-03.py (40 PASS).

CONVENTIONS (Paper 9 v1.6, pinned throughout): Theta_t = 1 + 2*Phihat,
Theta_s = 1 - 2*gamma_C*Phihat; clock calibration lambda_t = +1; ruler
response lambda_s = -gamma_C; plane trace theta = lambda_t + lambda_s
= 1 - gamma_C; shear sigma = (lambda_t - lambda_s)/2 = (1 + gamma_C)/2.

WHAT THE FOUR CHECKS CERTIFY:

check_T_gammaC_carrier_fork (tier 3, [P_structural]) -- the fork geometry,
exact rationals throughout:
  - The four carrier closures, SOLVED from their defining linear conditions
    (not hand-set): plane conservation (lambda_t + lambda_s = 0) -> gamma_C
    = 1; four-cell conservation (lambda_t + 3*lambda_s = 0) -> 1/3;
    per-channel closure (lambda_s = 0) -> 0; pooled/common depletion
    (lambda_s = +lambda_t) -> -1. Pairwise distinct, and CROSS-EXCLUSIVE:
    plane closure forces the four-cell trace to -2 (not 0); four-cell
    closure forces the plane trace to 2/3 (not 0).
  - The dimension table: gamma_GR(n) = 1/(n-2) for spatial dimension n.
    FLAGGED CONTINUUM IMPORT: this row is recomputed from trace-reversed
    linearized GR (h_00 = A(n-2)/(n-1), h_ij = A/(n-1)), an adopted
    continuum object, not native APF content. LOVELOCK NOTE: Gauss-Bonnet
    (and the higher Lovelock terms) contribute nothing to the linearized-
    around-flat static response, so gamma_GR(n) = 1/(n-2) holds for the
    whole Lovelock family, not just Einstein-Hilbert -- the dimension
    audit's kill rows are Lovelock-robust. The plane row matches the
    Einstein family ONLY at n = 3; the four-cell generalization (1/n),
    the per-channel row (0), and the pooled row (-1) match in NO
    dimension n >= 3.
  - The Cassini kills (gamma_obs = 1 +/- 2.3e-5): pooled = Nordstrom
    (gamma = -1, conformally flat response, zero first-order light
    deflection) excluded at ~8.7e4 sigma; per-channel (gamma = 0, half-GR
    deflection) excluded at ~4.3e4 sigma.
  - THE WEIGHT-ONE CURVE (the audit-donated mechanism decomposition):
    response = direct clock coupling + w * eta-weighted spread gives
    gamma(w) = w/((n-1)-w) exactly; gamma(1, n) = 1/(n-2) for n = 3..8
    (GR is w = 1 in EVERY dimension) and gamma(0, n) = 0 (direct-only is
    the per-channel carrier); the spread-only limit carries the SIGNED leg
    lambda_s = +lambda_t (the pooled shape, NOT the plane). The weight-one
    walk (derive w = 1) is the live opener of record.
  FALSIFIER HOOKS: a measured gamma_obs anomaly (any confirmed departure
  from gamma = 1 re-opens the fork empirically); ANY change to the Paper 9
  normal-form conventions (lambda_t = +1, lambda_s = -gamma_C) -- the fork
  values are convention-anchored and must be re-solved under a new normal
  form (the four-cell sign-slip artifact -1/3 vs +1/3 is the recorded
  cautionary example).

check_L_notrace_not_from_recruitment_instruments (tier 3,
[P_structural_instrument]) -- the T2 + T2' route closure:
  - Realizes the trace-obstruction countermodel (Paper 9
    def:trace-obstruction-coefficient): V_e(u, v; chi) = (A/2)u^2 +
    (B/2)(v - beta*chi)^2 - lambda*chi*u with A, B > 0 and lambda =
    A(1 - gamma) realizes ANY gamma_C = gamma at its unique minimum.
    gamma is derived from the NUMERICALLY MINIMIZED u (grid refinement
    against the closed form), not just read off the closed form, for
    gamma in {1, 1/3, 0, -1, 0.7}.
  - PINS the instrument enumeration as artifact data: the Paper 10
    Supplement B5 + B3.4 instruments; Paper 10 sec-8's clock-sector
    response principle (DISCHARGED: it prices lambda_t only -- clock-only
    per the parent walk); the recruitment.py bank instruments with their
    static-vacuity discharges (mu == 0 at the static fixed point: the
    master equation, relaxation, three regimes, and the rate-layer checks
    all hold as 0 = 0; the quantum-anchor package is silent for a single-
    branch classical static anchor); and the ADOPTED-OBJECTS EXCLUSION
    (Paper 25's eq:linearized-EH and the phi_T <-> h_munu identification
    are excluded from the licensing set BECAUSE adopted, S5 -- including
    them would close the gate by adoption, not derivation).
  - THE TRIPWIRE (the note's fence-removal condition, promoted to a live
    in-check leg): the check counts the check_* functions in
    apf/recruitment.py AT RUNTIME and FAILS LOUDLY if the name set differs
    from the pinned baseline. A new recruitment instrument banked later
    voids the enumeration baseline and forces a T2' re-audit BY FAILING
    THE BANK. Baseline note: the walk's enumeration was the ELEVEN checks
    present at walk time (through the .363 knee corollary); the twelfth,
    check_T_tls_transduction_class_discriminator_rule_D, landed in the
    concurrent .371 lane AFTER the walk's enumeration and BEFORE this
    banking -- per the tripwire's own rule that forced a re-audit, which
    was PERFORMED AT BANKING TIME (2026-07-03) and is recorded here: Rule
    D quantifies over TLS transduction-class adjudication (coverage below
    T_sat, design SNR) -- a rate-layer experimental-design instrument with
    no comparison-direction index and no quantification over (lambda_t,
    lambda_s); its static-vacuity discharge is the same one-liner as the
    knee corollary's. The pinned baseline is therefore the TWELVE names
    below; instrument thirteen (or any removal/rename) fails this check.
  SCOPE FENCE (docstring-load-bearing): this lemma certifies
  NON-DERIVABILITY FROM THE CORPUS AS FORMALIZED 2026-07-03 -- the B5 +
  B3.4 instruments, the sec-8 clock-sector principle, and the complete
  Papers 24/25 derived package. NEVER cite as "APF cannot derive gamma_C":
  non-derivability from APF is NOT claimed. The reservoir-exclusion route
  (L1 open + L2 banked partition + L3 finite sector check) and the
  weight-one walk are the live native routes.

check_L_register_carrier_not_from_account_instruments (tier 3,
[P_structural_instrument]) -- the register-carrier walk's banked form:
  - T-RC1 AT SCHEMA STRENGTH: rule-choice = response-choice. The four
    natural billing rules are realized as linear closure functionals and
    each is SOLVED for its selected gamma (computation over the rule
    definitions): plane billing -> 1; four-cell billing -> 1/3;
    nomological-redundancy billing RB -> 0; single-anchor pooled billing
    -> -1. Injective onto the fork; each rule's defining closure holds at
    its own point and fails at the other three.
  - THE LINEAR-RULE CONTINUUM (kills "bijection"): any rule marking
    c_t*lambda_t + c_s*lambda_s as line-requiring selects gamma = c_t/c_s
    -- pinned at three sample points plus the many-to-one witness
    ((1,1) and (3,3) select the same carrier). The rule -> carrier map is
    many-to-one ONTO the fork; no billing-layer datum strictly below the
    fork exists.
  - THE T_M THREE-TYPING CENSUS, stored as artifact data with the outcome
    set asserted exactly: cell-as-one-interface -> shared anchors -> one
    budget -> pooled (gamma = -1); channels-as-interfaces -> disjoint
    singleton anchors -> T_M-independent -> per-channel (gamma = 0);
    planes-as-interfaces -> the clock anchors in all three planes ->
    shared anchor -> T_M-INCONSISTENT as an independent-account
    decomposition (no carrier outcome). Under NO admissible typing does
    T_M yield the plane (gamma = 1). NEVER cite this leg as a flat
    refutation -- the TYPING DILEMMA is the banked form: T_M underdetermines
    the typing, and every admissible typing selects a Cassini-dead
    competitor or is inconsistent.
  - THE SIGNED MECHANISM-LIMIT LEGS (trace-reversal recomputation, exact):
    h_00 = A(n-2)/(n-1) and h_ij = A/(n-1) from the direct + eta-weighted-
    spread decomposition, ratio h_ij/h_00 = 1/(n-2); the signed conversion
    lambda_s/lambda_t = -h_ij/h_00 carried exactly; direct-only limit ->
    lambda_s = 0 (per-channel, exactly); spread-only limit -> lambda_s =
    +lambda_t EXACTLY (the pooled shape, sign included -- NOT the plane,
    which needs lambda_s = -lambda_t); plane balance at NEITHER limit.
  - THE H6' CLOSURE IDENTITY as a by-construction identity table:
    lambda_t + (n-2)*lambda_s = 0 identically in n for the Einstein
    family, plus the corollary lambda_t + n*lambda_s = 2*lambda_s (the
    load's net cell creation is exactly a spatial 2-plane's worth of ruler
    dilation). CAVEAT (docstring-load-bearing, per the walk's F-surface):
    H6' is the dimension-covariant form of the OUTPUT identity, adopted as
    TARGET SPEC, not a mechanism claim -- a native discharge may equally
    produce the trace-reversal decomposition, of which the register
    closure is the read-off. H6' is [C], the named reduction target; it
    is not banked by this check.

check_T_weight_one_reduction (tier 3, [P_structural]; ADDED v24.3.378,
2026-07-04) -- the weight-one walk banked ("Reference - The Weight-One
Walk - The Deposit Identity, the Asymmetric Pair, and the Live Cassini
Tension (2026-07-04)" v0.2, hostile-audit-repaired 0.83 -> 0.90; machine
witness The Turning/weight_one_witness_2026-07-04.py 36/36 PASS; the
note's Sec 5 bank spec followed verbatim):
  - L-W0 (deposit-fraction identity, exact rationals n = 3..8): w =
    D(spread deposit)/D(commitment), D the Euclidean cell-sum over the
    n+1 channel accounts; the denominator n-1 DISCHARGED as the cell's
    eta-sum; D-balance selects gamma = 1/(n-2) under EVERY democratic-
    eta normalization c ("w = 1" is a convention-bound label for a
    convention-free statement).
  - L-W1 (exchange annihilation): D annihilates clock<->ruler AND
    ruler-ruler exchange -- the v_e reductio has no purchase on the
    amount frame BY ARITHMETIC given the linear channel-uniform amount
    functional (TCP-min clause (ii), T4-selected within the anisotropic
    family), not by a billing fence.
  - L-W2 (scalar-improvement identity; exact formal basis + exact
    integer Fourier conservation leg): G_lin[h(w)] = kappa*T +
    ((1-w)/2)(eta box - dd) hbar; the improvement term identically
    conserved, vanishing IFF w = 1, in every n; w != 1 IS Paper 9's
    independent scalar mode (n = 3 calibrated trace source lambda/A =
    2(1-w)/(2-w)). FLAG: computed on the adopted linearized theory
    (continuum import, same flag as the dimension table).
  - fork w-coordinates: plane w = 1 at n = 3 ONLY (w_plane = (n-1)/2,
    scalar-tensor off n = 3); four-cell w = 1/2; per-channel w = 0;
    pooled at NO finite w (spread-only projective point w = n-1,
    h_00 = 0; gamma -> -1 as w -> +/-inf).
  - the SHAPE TABLE ("the shape carries the fork content"): under the
    SAME D-balance, eta-democratic -> the Einstein family in every n;
    rulers-only -> 1/n (four-cell, Cassini-dead); clock-only -> 0
    (per-channel, Cassini-dead). The eta-democratic shape S1 is the
    honest residual import.
  - the ANISOTROPIC FAMILY + THE T4 SELECTION: the channel-anisotropic
    functional (c_t, c_s) runs the same no-source route to the bound
    continuum gamma <= c_t/(n*c_s - 2*c_t) (n = 3 samples: 10/7, 5/8,
    exactly 1 at c_t = c_s); the bound tracks gamma_GR(n) = 1/(n-2) in
    every n IFF c_t = c_s -- the dimension audit uniquely selects
    channel-uniformity; the UNSIGNED (L1) channel-uniform balance lands
    on the four-cell family 1/n in every n -- a natural functional on a
    fork point, excluded by TCP-min's LINEARITY clause, not by taste.
  - THE THIRD COAT (docstring-load-bearing): "bill the D-net component"
    <=> the (1, n-2) linear rule of banked T-RC1 <=> H6-prime's closure
    identity -- at n = 3 exactly the plane rule (1, 1). Record-billing
    with a D-fence IS H6-prime restated: dead as a carrier-neutral
    route, DO-NOT-RE-WALK; never cite the D-fence as licensing
    record-billing. The currency/register boundary is amount-billing
    vs record-billing.
  - the CONDITIONAL HALVES (hypothesis artifacts; NOTHING here derives
    w = 1): TCP-min [C] and TCP-strong [C] stored verbatim; the
    asymmetric pair: no-source w <= 1 (gamma_C <= 1 at n = 3) at
    [P_structural | S0/S1 + TCP-min + H5-W + census legs + the Paper 9/
    Paper 10 base (P5, B7 incl. adopted C_M)]; no-sink (w >= 1)
    additionally requires TCP-strong, whose named discharge shape is an
    amount-graded testedness principle -- walked 2026-07-04 and priced
    as the (E)+(P) anatomy (apf/amount_graded_testedness.py). H5-W is
    the census-transport variant fence, named, unbanked, SEPARATE and
    standing.
  - CASSINI, SIGNED (Bertotti-Iess-Tortora 2003): gamma - 1 =
    (2.1 +/- 2.3)e-5 -- the central value sits 0.91 sigma ABOVE the
    bound (w - 1 = +1.05e-5 at central gamma): the bound survives at
    < 1 sigma under LIVE ONE-SIDED TENSION, not saturation; a factor-~3
    precision improvement at the same central value puts the composite
    under ~3 sigma pressure; a >= 3 sigma confirmed violation falsifies
    the composite (convention stored as artifact).
  - the FOOTPRINT KILL extension: the w-question's energetic footprint
    is ~2.2e-12 floor units at solar weak field; the approximate-A2/
    no-slack route is dead for w as it was for theta.
  - F-W2 TRIPWIRE (in-check, B2's style): the recruitment.py instrument
    name set is re-asserted against the pinned twelve-name baseline; a
    new ruler-sector or channel-anisotropic response instrument landing
    in the recruitment census fails this check loudly and forces a
    re-audit of TCP clause (ii)'s pricing (instruments landing outside
    that census remain E1-search-bounded, named).

STATUS. Fork check [P_structural]; the two route-closures
[P_structural_instrument] -- instrument-enumeration-bounded negatives in
the T2/T2' genre, tripwired; the weight-one reduction [P_structural] --
arithmetic-certificate + route-boundary genre. The weight-one walk is
WALKED and REDUCED (2026-07-04, banked here); the live openers are the
(E) distributed-encoding door (apf/amount_graded_testedness.py), the
shape question (derive eta-democracy), and H5 census-transport (separate,
standing). Nothing here derives gamma_C = 1 or w = 1; the conditional
composition of the parent walk (gamma_C = 1 given plane-carrier closure,
PLC [C]) stands unchanged.
